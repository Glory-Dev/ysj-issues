Dear readers,

Over the past month, we have spent a work heavy time to welcome 52 new junior researchers into our team. We also took the time to restructure the team into a more efficient and effective workflow. To train those junior researchers, we planned a 3-week filled training to teach the junior researchers the basics of research, brainstorming, and writing the actual paper.

Over the past 3 weeks, the Editor-In-Chief and the managing researchers conducted 3 webinars, talking about the research process, writing process and revising and proofreading the paper. All the junior researchers were required to conduct a group project as they were matched with fellow researchers with alike interests and had to complete a group article in the 3 weeks. In this period, each group was mentored by a senior researcher where the senior conducted 6 group sessions helping guide them through the process of writing their first review article.

On 17th of September, there was a presentation day, in which each group had to present a 10-minute presentation to explain their project thoroughly to the audience, and to a set of preselected judges. The projects presented were all of high caliber and impressed the judges. By the end of the training, the best project was awarded, and 3 runners-up were given awards. These groups have shown great dedication and enthusiasm for research and showcased that through their research project. Even more, they showed spectacular presentation skills, exhibiting their projects and showing off their work in 10 minutes.

Therefore, in this issue, we represent all the group projects created throughout the training, because we are proud of the endless effort that were done to write each and every article. We thank all the senior researchers for their tiring work as mentors, and all those who have helped make this issue possible.

Best Regards,<br>Youth Science Journal Community
