> Abstract

SCD is a serious inherited hemoglobinopathy that was responsible for the mortality of 376000 patients in 2021. The number of infants born with this genetic disorder was raised by 13.7% within the time interval from 2000 to 2021. Its fetal complications and painful VOC episodes are associated with a reduced quality of life and hospitalization and healthcare burden. Most SCD therapies are symptom-managing focused rather than curing the disease itself. This study mainly focused on the most life-threatening complications including cardiovascular complications and acute splenic sequestration, medications managing or curing them including hydroxyurea (HU) and gene therapy. HU was found to be effective in reducing cell sickling and was associated with improvements in organ functions represented in decreased acute chest syndromes and crises requiring blood transfusion. Its drawbacks were obvious in reduced sperm count and restricting erythroid cells' growth. Curing SCD gives lentiviral Gene therapy an advantage compared to HU. However, more research should be done on developing gene therapy to find out the reason and solution of malignancies reported in some cases.*

# Introduction

The disease of sickle cell anemia (SCD) was common in Africa for about 5000 years. A story of researching, discovering complications, and finding out medications, was written by great scientists, like chemist Dr. Linus Carl Pauling, Dr. Ingram, and others, to make an evolution from calling patients "ogbanjes" in Africa to the use of gene therapy techniques to treat it \[1\]. The disease is related to hemoglobin mutations that cause many disorders including sickle cell anemia. This disease starts with a single mutation in hemoglobin creating sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS). As a result, the shape of blood cells (from the name of the disease, sickle cell anemia) becomes crescent-like by a process of sickling the blood cells by interactions among erythrocytes, leukocytes, thrombocytes, and vascular endothelium. That leads to a blockage in the bloodstream resulting in dangerous complications and can lead to death. The complications have different levels, and some may not require hospital visits and others require intensive care units (ICU) \[12\]. Cardiovascular complications and acute splenic sequestration are some of those that can lead to death in both adults and children. Cardiovascular complications are clearly related to SCD by the fact that SCD can cause blockage near the heart. These complications can lead to a low supply of oxygen to the body leading to hard pain and high anemia. Because of the body's need for oxygen for its main functions, SCD affects those functions badly. Also, the spleen has an important role in the human body as it deals with dead blood cells. So, it is easily affected by closing splenic veins, by Vaso-occlusion, resulting in a complication called acute splenic sequestration (ASS). It leads to low hemoglobin levels, anemia, enlargement in the spleen size, probably splenectomy, and a mortality rate greater than 20 %. Generally, fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is known for its ability to reduce the effect of SCD \[6\]. That encouraged the researchers develop a medication called hydroxyurea. This medication can solve many of the cases and people who stick to it are predicted to have a longer life than others who don't stick to it. When the level of HbF becomes in- between 20% and 33%, SCD has no effect on the patients. However, some patients don't respond to this medication positively and others have no effects at all. Another group of patients respond negatively and some of the complications deteriorate. So, scientists recommend only the minimum effective level of this therapy to avoid these negative cases \[12\]. Another studied medication is lentiviral Gene therapy. It depends on the gene addition method, by lentiviral vectors, to reduce the effects of HbS. Its bad side effects are not popular, making it a recommended treatment for SCD.

# Hemoglobins

The human hemoglobin (Hb) is the factor that controls how the human body will be. Characteristics like length, eye color, and others have resulted from its function. There are many types of hemoglobin in humans. Some of them are healthy and normal and others are abnormal and can cause many disorders \[1\]. Mainly, the normal hemoglobins are adult hemoglobin (HbA), fetal hemoglobin (HbF), and HbA2. Typically, they consist of two different parts, which are Heme and Globin. Heme is a combination of an iron atom and porphyrin. The term porphyrin means a heterocyclic tetrapyrrole ring system. The four rings of porphyrin are connected, cyclically, by methene bridges \[21\]. Globin is made up of 2 alpha chains and 2 beta chains. This is HbA (α2 β2). Other normal hemoglobin types are HbA2 (α2δ2), which has 2 delta chains instead of the beta chains, and HbF (α2γ2), which has 2 gamma chains instead of the beta chains. The alpha chain consists of 141 amino acids and the origin of the two chains is the alpha gene cluster of chromosome 16, while beta chains are comprised of 146 amino acids and their origin is the beta gen cluster in chromosome 11 \[6\]. Adult hemoglobin (HbA) and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) have similar genes since they exist on chromosome 11. However, HbF production decreases in an accelerated manner after birth. In the healthy conditions, adults have 96:98%, \<3.5%, and \<1% of HbA, HbA2, and HbF respectively. In addition, HbA2 is just a minor component in the blood cells in humans. So, HbA is specifically the normal one after birth \[21\].
Sickle cell anemia patients have a high percentage of abnormal hemoglobin called hemoglobin S (HbS). HbS is different from HbA as HbS has a valine in the 6^th^ position in the beta chains instead of amino acid. So, this mutation causes the "sickle cell disease" \[6\]

# Sickle cell anemia

## i. Sickle cell anemia history

Sickle cell anemia was common in Africa for about 5000 years but that was not recorded well \[1\]. Some scientists believe that the origin of SCD mutation happened about 70--150,000 years ago. It is known that the term "ogbanjes" was used by African people to describe weak babies who were sickle cell anemia patients in the distant past \[6\]. Over the last two centuries, there were observations on humans and animals that led to the full discovery of sickle cell anemia. Firstly, in 1840, at the London Zoological Garden, a scientist called Gulliver noticed strange- shaped red blood cells in the blood cells of the deer in the garden \[4\]. They were crescent or sickle- shaped. At the same time, the white-tailed deer in North America in the forests of Michigan were dying because of Vaso-occlusive problems. In 1905, two French scientists published a report about "half- moon corpuscles" in the blood of 5% of 243 local Algerians who were anemia patients. The scientists wrongly related these sickle erythrocytes to malaria instead of SCD. Also, in 1904, a patient called Walter Clement Noel visited the hospital of Chicago Presbyterian since he was suffering from an ulcer on his ankle \[1\]. His physicians were James Bryan Herrick and his intern Ernest Eddward Irons \[6\]. After checking Noel's blood, Dr. Irons noticed strange blood cells and named them "peculiar, elongated, and sickle-shaped". So, by the end of 1910, Dr. Herrick connected the abnormalities in the red blood cells' shapes to the sickle cell anemia disease when he reported on "Peculiar Elongated and Sickle-Shaped Red Blood Corpuscles in a Case of Severe Anemia" in the "Archives of Internal Medicine". That was the first time to do so, as a result, 1910 is described as the discovery year of sickle cell anemia disease \[1\]. The first scientist who denominate the disease by "sickle cell anemia" was Verne Raheem Mason in 1922 \[6\]. In 1927, it was discovered that removing oxygen makes red blood cells of patients, with sickle cell anemia, sickle. In addition, some of the patients' families' blood cells were sickling by removing oxygen although they had no symptoms. So, those people were called "sickle traits". That was the first discovered cause-effect relationship between the sickling of sickle cells and acidic conditions and low oxygen, by two scientists called Hahn and Gillespie \[10\]. In 1949, other two physicians, called Dr. James V. Neel and Col. E. A. Beet, proved that sickle cell anemia is an inherited disease that the patients are homozygous and carry two alleles of sickle cell anemia while sickle cell traits are heterozygous and carry one allele of sickle cell anemia \[1\]. In the same year, the famous chemist Dr. Linus Carl Pauling with his co-worker Dr. Harvey discovered the cause-effect relationship between an abnormality in the chemical structure of hemoglobin molecule and sickle cell anemia \[10\]. Sickle cell anemia is the first disease that took the name "molecular disease". This term was coined by Dr. Linus Carl Pauling and Dr. Harvey after their findings. Thanks to this discovery, Dr. Linus Pauling received a Nobel Prize in 1954 \[1\]. After two years, the details of the irregularity of hemoglobin in sickle cell patients were discovered clearly by a scientist called Dr. Ingram. In 1956, he found that the 6^th^ position of the amino acid chain has amino acid valine instead of glutamic. Counting from the amino- terminal, that 6^th^ position was the only strange one on the whole amino acid chain of SCD patients' blood \[6\]. That was one of the most important discoveries in sickle cell anemia. In the following years, more details were discovered, and the complications were clearly related to the disease itself. It was found that the mutation of glutamine-to- valine substitution happens in the beta-globin chain at chromosome 11. To ensure supporting SCD patients and their families Dr. Charles F. Whitten in the 1970s helped the "Sickle Cell Disease Association of America" (SCDAA) to be founded. Nowadays, 90% and 50% of SCD patients can live to the age of 20 and 50 respectively. The average age of SCD patients is about 58 years for women and 53 for men. This indicates the improvement in curing and supporting SCD patients. Because in the past, "ogbanjes" were dying at an early age \[1\].

## ii. Pathophysiology of SCD

The pathophysiology of sickle cell anemia starts with the arising of Sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS). That happens because of the mutation in the hemoglobin (Hb) beta chain, as at the 6^th^ position, it has the amino acid valine, while the normal one is glutamate. This glutamine-to-valine substitution occurs as a result of an original mutation when the 6^th^ codon in the beta- globin chain has thymine instead of adenine \[25\]. This mutation creates the HbS and enables it to form polymers under deoxy conditions \[13\]. In addition, it causes abnormality in molecular stability and solubility. The deoxy conditions result in forming a polymer, increasing its viscosity, and decreasing solubility. Also, the deoxy conditions make HbS form tactiods, a gel-like material \[1\]. There is an equilibrium between the tactiods and the liquid- soluble form of HbS. This equilibrium is affected by the concentration of HbS, the existence of other hemoglobins, and oxygen tension. Oxygen tension affects the formation of the polymer. Polymer formation happens only in the deoxy state and the presence of oxygen increases the liquid state. In addition, the tactiods form of HbS happens when the concentration of HbS is greater than 20.8 g/dL. The existence of Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can cause decreasing in the tactiods formation. So, patients that have high levels of HbF have weaker disease than patients that have low HbF levels \[1\]. So, HbS effects do not occur clearly until the age of six months to 2 years after declining the level of HbF. Also, people who are compound heterozygotes for HbS have one- third concentration of HbF, of all hemoglobins, which is the needed concentration for protecting their cells from deoxy-induced damage \[1\]. HbS causes chronic anemia in patients as the life cycle of their blood cells is 10-20 days instead of the normal life cycle, of 90-120 days \[12\]. The upregulation and expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, the formation of dense red cells, and repeated sickling of the red blood cells cause one of the most dangerous processes which is Vaso-occlusion \[1\]. Many different reasons affect this process \[18\]. One of the most important reasons is the formation, or expression, of "adhesion molecules" on blood cells. Cells adhere to each other and to the vascular endothelium \[10\]. When this process happens in postcapillary venules, it increases the times of microvascular transit \[1\]. Stasis is caused by increased leukocyte recruitment and Inflammatory activation of endothelium in addition to the adhesion of sickle red cells. Many adhesion molecules are expressed on sickle cells. For example, CD36, α-4- β-1 integrin, intercellular adhesion molecule‐4 (ICAM‐4), and Basal cell adhesion molecule (B- CAM) are all formed on the sickle red cells \[10\]. During the crisis, there is a huge, expressed amount of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the sickle cells' membrane. That leads to formatting microparticles (MP) and contributes to increasing the crisis. Microparticles are used as a measurement of the activity of the disease of sickle cell anemia \[18\]. Vascular cell adhesion molecule‐1 (VCAM‐1) increases on the endothelial cells with the help of interleukin‐18 (IL‐18) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF‐α) in inflammatory processes. There is another way that leads to erythrocyte-endothelium adhesion. That happens by molecules called "bridging molecules". Von Willebrand factor (vWF), thrombospondin (TSP), and fibronectin (FN) are some of those molecules that help erythrocyte- endothelium adhesion \[18\]. Nitric oxide (NO) existence helps to the sickling the red blood cells which in turn leads to hemolysis. Hemolysis contributes to the existence of free hemoglobin and further leads to Vaso-occlusion. Reticulocytes are usually released by hemolysis \[18\]. In addition, α-4- β-1 integrin and ICAM‐4 are common adhesive molecules in reticulocytes which have very large amounts of them. In fact, erythrocytes bind to reticulocytes and endothelium in sickle cell anemia because of ICAM‐4's ability to bind to not only α-4- β-1 integrin, but also very late antigen (VLA‐4) \[1\]. α-4-β-1 integrin has the ability to bind to many kinds of adhesive proteins, or molecules, such as vWF, thrombospondin (TSP), ICAM-4, and laminin in its soluble case. However, it is found that its antibodies can inhibit the adhesion of sickle erythrocytes.

All these adhesion processes lead to many crises and can damage the internal organs. The most affected organs are the lungs, the heart, and the kidneys. In babyhood, sickle cell anemia can affect them by frequent infection because of Haemophilus influenza, salmonella, and streptococcus pneumonia. Also, it can lead to a of the dorsum of the feet and hands, which is called dactylitis \[17\]. So, all these steps and pathophysiology from the mutations that lead to all these complications make sickle cell anemia one of the most dangerous diseases.

# Complications

## i-insight

Unfortunately, some SCD complications don't show improvement and may even deteriorate more during HU therapy, including childhood avascular necrosis and priapism. Moreover, 25-30% of patients suffering from SCD have suboptimal or no response at all to HU treatment [14]. Furthermore, the HUSTLE trial reported long-term toxicities in children. Also, myelosuppression is a common HU adverse effect among patients intaking higher doses and older patients. To reduce its probability of occurrence, the minimum effective dose is recommended. HU also has negative effects on spermatogenesis as it reduces sperm count and motility which normally don't return to normal even after giving off HU intake. Also, azoospermia was reported in patients treated with HU [4].
