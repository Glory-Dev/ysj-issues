<Abstract>
  Hello there<Tooltip data={frontmatter} no="1">1</Tooltip> This is me

  Egypt\'s educational system, comprising public and private institutions across all levels, faces multiple issues affecting its quality, equity, and relevance. A recent study by Egypt\'s Ministry of Health identified that 29.8% of high school students experience mental health problems like anxiety, speech defects, depression, stress and tension, emphasizing the significance of addressing such concerns. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a random sample study of 130 students from the STEM and conventional educational systems in Egypt to compare their perceived stress levels. An online Arabic questionnaire was shared with the targeted population over a period of two weeks. The questionnaire included inquiries about academic and demographic information as well as the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Respondents were asked about their personal information, academic performance, extracurricular activities, average studying hours, and perceived stress levels. The PSS-10 assessed stress levels based on questions covering coping, control, unpredictability, and overload. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25. Major findings revealed that STEM students suffer from higher stress levels than conventional students, mainly due to fewer hours of sleep. Additionally, significant differences were found in stress levels between male and female students across the sample. These findings underscore the need to address academic pressures and establish appropriate mental health screening in STEM schools to mitigate negative emotional effects. They are crucial in developing effective strategies for minimizing student stress levels, and educational institutions should utilize this data to assess their curriculum and make any necessary changes.

In simulating quantum mechanics, we are first interested in the solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation,

<Equation number="1.1.1">
  $$
  j\hbar \; \frac{\partial}{\partial t} |\; \psi(t)\rangle \; = \hat{H}|\psi(t)\rangle
  $$
</Equation>

where $H = -\frac{\hslash^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V$ represents the Hamiltonian or the total energy of the wavefunction $\psi$ This can be further thought of as $\psi (t) = e^{-iHt} \psi (0)$ propagates the initial state $\psi (0)$ ‘s
evolution through time. The Schrodinger’s equation is a useful representation of quantum dynamics because it fundamentally describes how quantum systems evolve and their Eigen states, respectively. Additionally, it takes a
time-independent form $\hat{H} \psi = \hat{E} \psi$, but we will be focusing mainly on the time-dependent form and the applications resulting from it.

## I. Introduction

As we navigate through the academic jungle, it\'s no secret that we may encounter academic-related stress, which is an aspect of most Egyptian students\' life. A new study published by Egypt\'s Ministry of Health reveals that 29.8% of high-school students suffer from anxiety, tension, speech defects, or depression disorders. Deadlines, parental and societal pressure, desire for perfection, and poor time management are among the most common causes of stress among high school students.

Egypt\'s educational system is one of the biggest in Africa and the Middle East, comprising both public and private institutions at primary, preparatory, secondary, and tertiary levels. Despite governmental efforts to improve education, however, the system continues to be riddled with several problems that negatively affect overall mental health among students. Egypt\'s high school system offers diverse programs geared toward career fields, including general, vocational, and technical education.

Despite the significant efforts in the field of educational psychology, no previous studies- to the best of our knowledge- have addressed the difference between stress levels among STEM schools students in Egypt and conventional schools, taking into account the learning system, the social interactions, extracurriculars, personal habits, and extra projects and tasks.

Therfore, this study aims to compare the prevalence of perceived stress among two major educational systems in Egypt, STEM high schools and conventional high schools, as they differ in academic advancement levels, curriculum, teaching methods, extracurriculars, skills, and knowledge they aim to impart. As well as determining and analyzing possible demographic and academic factors related to stress levels among both populations.

The methodology involved conducting an online Arabic survey asking for necessary demographic and academic information as well as the ten questions of the Perceived stress scale. Data were collected from 130 respondents, including males and females, STEM and non-STEM students, various academic levels, and educational grades. Data were analyzed to examine the difference in stress levels between both populations and the significance of association between stress levels and other variables.

Ensuring that the study is designed ethically and fairly to benefit students and educational institutions in Egypt, we will ensure that the findings and results of the study can be practically implemented in educational administrations.

### Hypotheses

**Null Hypothesis (1):** There will be no statistically significant difference between STEM educational system\'s students and the conventional educational system\'s students regarding perceived stress levels.

**Null Hypothesis (2):** There will be no statistically significant difference between males and females regarding perceived stress levels.

**Null Hypothesis (3):** There will be no statistically significant difference between different educational grades (Grades 10 & 11 & 12) in terms of perceived stress levels.

## II. Literature Review

Intensive research and experiments have been conducted to find the relation between academic performance and stress (including psychological, physical, social, and academic stress). Previous research has indicated a significant negative impact of stress on academic performance, which was roughly equal between males and females, ensuring that teachers play a vital role in reducing stress among their students \[1\]. Indirect stress may develop due to task load requirements \[2\], and stressed students tend to be slower and more considerate in their actions \[3\]. Stressors are widely spread among secondary school students in boarding schools; specifically, about 44.9% of pupils experience academic-related stressors \[4\].

To reduce levels of stress, experiments have been conducted on the effect of extracurriculars on reducing the amount of stress among high school students, and the results showed that students who participate in extracurricular activities show fewer levels of stress and worry \[5\]. Other studies showed that participation in extracurricular activities moderates the relation between academic related stress and coping and positively influences well- being \[6\]. Further approaches to reduce stress levels among students include developing social interactions with family, friends, and society. A preceding study has indicated that levels of stress among high school students were significantly predicted by family support, whilst levels of depression were significantly predicted by friends' support \[7\]. Another study comparing between conventional and boarding schools concerning their social activities has indicated that conventional school students showed higher levels of peer-group integration than students from boarding schools, on the other hand, boarding school students showed higher success in gaining autonomy from parents and forming romantic relationships \[8\].

## III. Methodology

**1. Participants:**

  This research employs a mixed online survey that lasted for two sequential weeks starting from the 11<sup>th</sup> of August, 2023. It was used to obtain data from a random sample of students from both the conventional educational system and STEM educational system in Egypt. 130 anonymous responses were collected from various high schools and localities in Egypt.

**2. Measurements**

  **2.1. Demographics**: Respondents were asked to fill in their personal information, including birth date, gender, and average sleeping hours.
  
  **2.2. Academic Information**: Respondents were asked about their academic performance, extracurricular activities during school months, average studying hours, educational system, educational level, as well as their academic grades.
  
  **2.3. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)**: The perceived stress scale (PSS) is a structured questionnaire used for assessing the level of stress that a population or a sample of it faces during a specific period. The test includes ten questions that cover topics such as coping, control, unpredictability, and overload. Questions such as \" In the last month, How often have you felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life? " were asked, and the respondent was required to give an answer on a scale from 0 (Never) to 4 (Very Often). The final score will be the sum of the scores of each question by reversing the scores of questions 4, 5, 7, and 8. Where in these four questions, a score of 4 is actually 0, 3 is 1, 2 is 2, 1  is 3, and 0 is 4. A final score of 0-13 indicates low stress levels, 14-26 indicates moderate stress levels, and 27-40 indicates that the respondent suffers from severe stress.

**3. Procedures**

  In order for the data to be collected effectively, a structured online validated Arabic questionnaire of multiple choice questions was done using Google Forms. It was accessible to the targeted populations and sent to them via social media and mail platforms, for instance, WhatsApp and Microsoft Outlook. Daily reminders for filling out the form were sent as well.
  
  Participants\' responses, which included concise/clear answers for the demographic, academic information, and PSS-10 sections, were recorded. Two weeks later, data were collected and begun to be analyzed.

**4. Data collection and instrumentation**

The collected data represented the score of stress of each individual, as well as other necessary information for testing the hypotheses. All analytic processes were done using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25 tool. Descriptive statistics tests were done to determine similarities and differences among both populations. *Table \[1\]* shows statistical methods used to compare between both populations (STEM & non- STEM). *Table \[2\]* shows statistical methods used to determine the relation between different demographic/ academic variables and stress scores.

## IV. Results

## iii. Star Formation

Once the gas has condensed into the halo\'s central regions, it may start to self-gravitate or be driven more by its gravity than by dark matter. If cooling processes prevail overheating, then a runaway process can occur in which Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) complexes form, and eventually some dense cloud cores within these complexes collapse and reach the extreme densities required to ignite nuclear fusion. This is because gas cools more quickly the higher its density, so if cooling processes dominate, then a run-away process can occur \[6\]. Many aspects of this process are still unclear, though. According to observations \[8\] \[9\], 1% of molecular gas turns into stars every period of free fall, which is a practically universal efficiency for star formation \[10\]. The gas is often transformed into star particles using a probabilistic sampling approach based on a calculated star formation rate \[10\]. Many cosmological simulations are unable to distinguish between individual cores, much less the scales on which GMC emerges. Therefore, to describe star formation, all current cosmological simulations use empirical sub-grid recipes. Since cold, dense gas eventually gives rise to stars, simulations convert a portion of this gas into collisionless star particles, which reflect coeval, single-metallicity stellar populations that are characterized by an underlying initial stellar mass function \[10\]. A few simulations additionally take star clusters into account as the primary unit of star formation by enabling the expansion of star particles through accretion from the surrounding medium. This is an alternative to the probabilistic sampling strategy and helps to better mimic the clustered nature of star formation. Modern galaxy formation models track stellar evolution and the mass return of these stars to the gas component after stellar particles have been generated.
