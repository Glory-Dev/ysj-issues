        Letter from the Journal
      </h2>
      <div class="content">
        Dear readers,
        <br />
        <span>
          We are thrilled to present the remarkable works showcased in this issue, a testament to the dedicated efforts of our researchers over the past year. This edition features outstanding projects from our revamped research program as well as
          top-rated submissions received through our journal website.
        </span>
        <span>
          This season, we implemented significant changes to our research program, extending its duration to eight weeks. During this period, junior researchers underwent a thorough and enriching experience, beginning with an intensive training
          course that equipped them with essential skills in scientific research, idea generation, and paper writing. Participants engaged in collaborative group projects with peers sharing similar interests, successfully producing articles within
          this extended timeframe.
        </span>
        <span>
          One of the key enhancements this season was the introduction of individual mentoring sessions. Each junior researcher attended these sessions with senior researchers to monitor their progress and apply the knowledge gained throughout the
          program. This personalized guidance, coupled with the continuation of group mentoring sessions, provided robust support as the teams developed their inaugural review papers.
        </span>
        <span>
          Following the completion of their projects, each group presented their findings in concise 10-minute sessions to a distinguished panel of judges. The depth of ideas and the quality of the projects were truly commendable. Participants
          received constructive feedback that highlighted their performance in key areas such as defining a research question, methodology, and presentation skills, demonstrating their dedication to academic excellence.
        </span>
        <span>
          Our editorial team also diligently reviewed numerous papers submitted to the Youth Science Journal website for publication. After a rigorous revision process, we reached out to the authors of papers that showcased academic novelty and
          significant contributions to their respective fields. We are excited to feature articles from various STEM and Humanities disciplines, including interdisciplinary ones, and we look forward to the continued review of submitted articles.
        </span>
        <span>
          This issue proudly presents the exceptional group projects created during the extended training program and the selected submissions from our website. We express our deepest gratitude to our senior researchers for their invaluable mentoring
          and extend heartfelt thanks to all contributors who made this publication possible.
        </span>

        Best Regards,
        <br />
